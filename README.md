# Flappy-Bird-AI
This is something I made to improve my understanding of how fitness functions reward certain behaviour in an evolving neural network. To do this, I followed this brilliant guide (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lwGZWXz5Qgta_YNX3_vLS2) that walks through the code, along with the overarching theory. For a better understanding of the NEAT module itself, I found it helpful to look through the actual code. Even though there are a lot of moving elements that I'm not familiar with yet, it did provide some needed context for how the neural network operates in the background.

For example, the module consumes data from the config file to manipulate bird genomes, and how the bird with the highest potential passes along it's progress to be inherited by the next generation.
